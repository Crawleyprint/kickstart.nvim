 [[ Configure and install plugins ]]

  To check the current status of your plugins, run
    :Lazy

  You can press `?` in this menu for help. Use `:q` to close the window

  To update plugins you can run
    :Lazy update

 NOTE: Here is where you install your plugins.
 NOTE: Plugins can be added with a link (or for a github repo: 'owner/repo' link).
'tpope/vim-sleuth',  Detect tabstop and shiftwidth automatically

 NOTE: Plugins can also be added by using a table,
 with the first argument being the link and the following
 keys can be used to configure plugin behavior/loading/etc.

 Use `opts = {}` to force a plugin to be loaded.


 NOTE: Plugins can also be configured to run Lua code when they are loaded.

 This is often very useful to both group configuration, as well as handle
 lazy loading plugins that don't need to be loaded immediately at startup.

 For example, in the following configuration, we use:
  event = 'VimEnter'

 which loads which-key before all the UI elements are loaded. Events can be
 normal autocommands events (`:help autocmd-events`).

 Then, because we use the `config` key, the configuration only runs
 after the plugin has been loaded:
  config = function() ... end

 NOTE: Plugins can specify dependencies.

 The dependencies are proper plugin specifications as well - anything
 you do for a plugin at the top level, you can do for a dependency.

 Use the `dependencies` key to specify the dependencies of a particular plugin

 LSP Plugins

 The following two comments only work if you have downloaded the kickstart repo, not just copy pasted the
 init.lua. If you want these files, they are in the repository, so you can just download them and
 place them in the correct locations.

 NOTE: Next step on your Neovim journey: Add/Configure additional plugins for Kickstart

  Here are some example plugins that I've included in the Kickstart repository.
  Uncomment any of the lines below to enable them (you will need to restart nvim).
